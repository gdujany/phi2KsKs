I would like to thank my supervisors Giulio Dujany and George Lafferty for giving me the opportunity to be a CERN summer student. Thank you for your support and counseling, it was great working with you! 
Thank you to Jonathan Harrison for providing a good part of the basis for my work and to Lorenzo Capriotti for helping me with my first steps using the Grid. 
I am very grateful to the entire LHCb group of the University of Manchester for welcoming me this summer.
