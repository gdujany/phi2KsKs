\section{CPT invariance}
The Standard Model of Particle Physics builds on the assumption of invariance under CPT transformation, i.e. the invariance under combined charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time inversion (T). As the CPT theorem states, this invariance is given for any quantum theory formulated on flat space-times, provided the theory
respects (i) Locality, (ii) Unitarity (i.e. conservation of probability), and (iii) Lorentz invariance \cite{LUDERS19571},\cite{Bernabeu:2006st}.

With the system $\phi \rightarrow K^0 \overline{K}^0$, the aspect of unitarity, which - if not given - allows for CPT violation within quantum mechanics, can be probed.
